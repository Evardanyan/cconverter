You're in the bank. Think about how much and what kind of currency you have.

Take the currency code, the amount of money the user has, and the currency code that the user wants to receive as the user input.
Retrieve the data from FloatRates as in the previous exercises.
Save the exchange rates for USD and EUR.
Read the currency to exchange for and the amount of money.
Take a look at the cache. Maybe you already have what you need?
If you have the currency in your cache, calculate the amount.
If not, get it from the site, and calculate the amount.
Save all the information to your cache.
Print the results.
Repeat steps 4-9 until there is no currency left to process.
